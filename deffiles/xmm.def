### options for matching mzXML scans to MS1 features.
### Parameters indicated with a * in the description are only relevant if -pseudoSH is not used
min_Tr 0                      # min retention time in minutes
max_Tr 110                    # max retention time in minutes
charge_states 2,3,4,5,6,7     # charge states to be considered
mz_tolerance 0.1              # *m/z tolerance for peak to scan matching: when not used with pseudoSH 0.1
deltaTr 1.0                   # *tolerated retention time in minutes for feature matching: when not used with pseudoSH 1.0
Trshift 0.0                   # *constant Tr shift in minutes. positive value means MS2 scans are later than MS1 Master
scanlevels 2                  # *define scanlevels, more than on scanlevel is defined as e.g. 2,3
Tr_offset 0                   # *offset for feature matching e.g. 30 mins all features eluting before 30 min. are matched irrespective of deltaTr parameter
require_same_charge 0         # *precursor charge in mzXML file needs to match charge that SuperHirn reports. 0 indicates no charge matching, 1 means only matching charges are used
feature_plusmz 0              # *add a constant mass to feature mz for significance testing
matchtype most_intense        # *Tr_distance_2apex or most_intense
monotoggle 0                  # *match 2nd isotope
msInstrumentIDs 0             # Instrument ID

### scan matching and inclusion list options
IL_bin_offset 40            # first segment is from 0 to indicated number 0 means no offest
IL_bin_overlap 50           # overlap in % of inclusion list bins
IL_bin_segmentsize 7        # inclusion list segmentsize in minutes
IL_bin_limits 0,110         # Tr limits for inclusion list "0" means automatic "20,100" means from 20 to 100 min
IL_charges 2,3,4,5,6,7      # only features with indicated charges are put into inclusion list e.g 2,3 means charge 2+ and 3+, 0 means all charges, 2 means only charge 2+
IL_nmostintense 0           # use n-most intense features e.g. 1,1000 means 1 to 1000, 0 means all features
inclusionlisttype all       # "inclusion" or "exclusion" or "all" inclusion adds all features that do not have scans in inclusion list, exclusion all features with scan
bins_min 0                  # 0,5,10,30 # 0: automatic 0,5,10,30,etc defines lower boundaries
bins_max 0                  # 10,15,30,40 # 0: automatic 5,10,30,40,etc defines upper boundaries
